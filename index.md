#  Critique and redesign： Asia food in US story telling

## Step one: the visualization

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/23/71-of-asian-restaurants-in-the-u-s-serve-chinese-japanese-or-thai-food/

I chose this visualization because it highlights cultural and demographic trends through the lens of food, a topic both accessible and socially meaningful. The charts trys to convey a lot of information, but when I first reading I found their are potential to make the plot more clear and easy to understand. By improving how the story of Asian cuisine in the U.S. is communicated, I can practice clarifying complex idea while maintaining visual appeal. 
## Step two: the critique

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question                                              | Interview 1 (23 years old, student with plotting background)                                                                                                   | Interview 2 (50 years old,, engineer)                                                                                          | Interview 3 (18 years old, high school student)                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can you tell me what you think this is?               | “This is a set of charts showing how many U.S. restaurants serve Asian cuisines, broken down by type and location.”                                  | “Looks like it’s about Asian food in the U.S., maybe trying to show where people eat it most often.”                | “It’s about Asiian food restaurants, like which type are most common and where.”                             |
| Can you describe to me what this is telling you?      | “Chinese, Japanese, and Thai dominate. About 12% of all restaurants are Asian. Certain counties like Honolulu and Bay Area have really high shares.” | “Main point is that Asian food isn’t huge nationwide but is big in some regions. Also, Chinese is the most common.” | “Most Asian restaurants are Chinese or Japanase. Hawaii has a lot of them compared to other places.”         |
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?   | “The headline say 71%, but that’s not visible on the chart. Overlapping categories aren’t explained.”                                               | “The county maps confuse me. Some big empty areas look dark even though probably not many restaurants there.”       | “I wasn’t sure what the donut chart meant at first. The maps look cool but are kind of hard to read.”        |
| Who do you think is the intended audience for this?   | “General readers and journalists. The design is polished for media use.”                                                                             | “Probably everyday readers, maybe policymakers. It’s not written for technical people.”                             | “Just people interested in food and culture. I think it’s made for the public.”                              |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? | “Visualize the 71% number directly, maybe restructure categories.”                                              | “Simplify the maps or just use a ranked list of top counties. The colors don’t tell me scale easily.”               | “Make the charts simpler, like one main bar chart. Maybe add pictures or icons of food to make it more fun.” |


Synthesis: 

Feedback showed consistent confusion about mixed denominators, the invisible 71% statistic, and county map distortions. Participants wanted clearer encoding, simplified visuals, and engaging elements. I learned that accessibility matters as much as accuracy.
